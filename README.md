# Live-Inventory-System

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?

We're rolling up our sleeves to develop an intuitive and efficient inventory management system for The Cube (ICICS 012), a vital hub for UBC computer science students, especially for affordable food on campus. Students will have a seamless experience of selecting items and checking out with the Square terminal, and the system automatically adjusts the inventory and displays the total cost. Moreover, officers can easily restock by scanning barcodes or entering details manually. Plus, proactive notifications of dwindling inventory levels are integrated into the system, keeping everyone ahead of the game.

### Why is it important?

This project will enhance the efficiency of The Cube, a place where hundreds of granola bars, chips, instant noodles, and frozen desserts are consumed monthly . By simplifying inventory management and integrating it with the checkout process, we can significantly streamline operations, ensuring The Cube always has their stock in check and popular items available. It's an opportunity to make a direct impact on the student community, improving the way The Cube operates and enriching the experience for everyone who uses it.

### Key Technologies/Skills:

#### For Developers:

This program is about applying what you already know and learning even more! Any previous experience in these areas would be a bonus, but it's not a requirement:
- **Web Development:** Some familiarity with both front-end and back-end technologies.
- **API Integrations:** If you've worked with API integrations, especially Square terminal's, that would be great.
- **Domain knowledge:** Understanding students who go to the CUBE, why itâ€™s important, and how inventory systems usually work are preferable.

#### For Tech Leads:

As a Tech Lead, you should have a strong foundation in the skills above, along with:
- **Firmware & Software Integrations:** Depending on your plan, you may need to integrate the square reader with other technologies.
- **Team Leadership:** The ability to guide and coordinate a team of developers is a must.
- **User Experience Design:** The ability to guide the team in creating a user-friendly system.
- **Advanced features:** If you have experience with building tools with notifications, or that deal with sensitive data like financial data, that would be a plus!
